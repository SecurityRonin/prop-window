**A film prop window: put any URL on camera, no matter where the page comes from.**

Real Chromium (Electron), with a Chrome-style chrome we draw ourselves — so the address
bar shows whatever you tell it, fully decoupled from the page actually loaded. Point it at
a local mock or a live site; the bar reads `https://www.yourfilm.example` with a padlock.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SecurityRonin/prop-window
cd prop-window && npm install

# Load any content, show any URL on camera:
DISPLAY_URL="https://www.peanutforum.com/thread/48213" \
LOAD_URL="http://localhost:8234/forum.html" \
FULLSCREEN=1 npm start
```

The window is a real browser rendering `LOAD_URL`; the toolbar shows `DISPLAY_URL`. In
fullscreen there's no real browser chrome on screen — only the one we draw.

### macOS: one-time trust step

macOS XProtect currently false-positives on unsigned Electron dev binaries (the same alert
that hit ChatGPT, Cursor, and Codex in 2026) and moves them to Trash. To run your own local
build, ad-hoc sign it once after install:

```bash
npm run mac:trust   # clears the download-quarantine flag and ad-hoc signs the local build
npm start
```

This only affects this project's local copy — it changes no system settings. Signed,
notarized distribution builds are deferred (see CHANGELOG).

## Why not an extension or a Chromium fork?

- **An extension can't do it.** Browsers forbid extensions from writing an arbitrary value
  into the omnibox — the address bar always reflects the page's true origin. That's an
  anti-phishing rule with no override.
- **A Chromium source fork is the wrong tool.** Patching the omnibox means editing
  security-critical navigation C++, a ~100 GB tree, and multi-hour builds.
- **Electron _is_ Chrome.** Same engine, packaged so we own the window chrome. The content
  is a real top-level `BrowserView` (not an `<iframe>`), so it loads **any** site — external
  ones included — with no `X-Frame-Options` limits, while the address bar stays under our
  control.

## Configure per shot (environment variables)

| Var                | Meaning                                      | Default                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `LOAD_URL`         | content actually fetched                     | bundled welcome page      |
| `DISPLAY_URL`      | URL shown in the address bar (the spoof)     | `https://www.example.com` |
| `TITLE`            | tab title                                    | `New Tab`                 |
| `FAVICON`          | emoji, or an image URL                       | `🌐`                      |
| `SECURE`           | `0` → "Not secure"; else padlock             | padlock                   |
| `FULLSCREEN`       | `1` → fullscreen (only our chrome on camera) | off                       |
| `KIOSK`            | `1` → kiosk (no escape chrome)               | off                       |
| `BORDERLESS`       | `1` → drop our chrome; page draws its frame  | off                       |
| `WIDTH` / `HEIGHT` | windowed size                                | `1440` × `900`            |

## Borderless mode (the page draws its own frame)

By default the app draws a Chrome-style toolbar and fake address bar. **Borderless**
drops all of that — no toolbar, no BrowserView — and loads the page straight into a
single frameless window, so the _page_ supplies the frame. Use it when the content
already looks like a native window and a second border would give the prop away — e.g.
the [Kali window mockup](https://hacker-film-mockup.vercel.app/mockups/kali-window.html),
which draws a Kali 2026.2 window decoration around any inner mockup.

```bash
npm start -- --borderless \
  --url "https://hacker-film-mockup.vercel.app/mockups/kali-window.html?app=osint-nexus-graph.html&title=NEXUS%20OSINT"
```

CLI flags (override env/scene):

| Flag               | Meaning                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `--borderless`     | drop our chrome (same as `BORDERLESS=1`)      |
| `--url <url>`      | page to load (same as `LOAD_URL`)             |
| `--screenshot <p>` | render, capture the window to `<p>.png`, quit |

A packaged Windows `.exe` launches the same way — pass the flags in the shortcut's
_Target_:

```
prop-window.exe --borderless --url "https://…/kali-window.html?app=osint-nexus-graph.html&title=NEXUS%20OSINT"
```

> **Behind auth?** If the live URL sits behind Vercel deployment protection (Basic
> auth), the operator gets a login prompt instead of the mockup. Make the specific
> mockup path public, disable protection for that project, or append a
> protection-bypass token — the borderless window has no chrome to type credentials
> into cleanly on camera.

## On-set controls

- **Address bar is the spoof control.** Click it and type any URL.
  - **Enter** → set the _displayed_ URL (content unchanged) — the spoof.
  - **Shift+Enter** → actually navigate the content to the typed URL.
- **Back / Forward / Reload** drive the real content view.
- The top strip is a window-drag handle when not fullscreen.

## Trust but verify

- **Tested logic ships.** The URL parsing, favicon detection, config, and Enter-key
  semantics live in `src/` under **100% line/branch/function coverage** (vitest), and the
  preload exposes those _same_ functions to the renderer — no untested copy in the HTML.
- **Humble Object shell.** The Electron layer (`electron/*`) carries no decisions, so it
  stays a thin, reviewable shell over Chromium.

## What this is — and isn't

A **stage prop**: a picture of a browser, for a camera. It performs no network deception —
the address bar is a widget we draw, so there is nothing intercepted or forged on the wire.
Use it for filming and demos.
